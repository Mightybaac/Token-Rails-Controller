This code is a Ruby on Rails controller that displays the price for the Solana token (SYMBOL: SOL). It does this by making a GET request to the Solana API and parsing the response as JSON. The API returns the prices for multiple cryptocurrencies, and the code only extracts the price for the SOL token.

The code starts by defining the symbol for the Solana token and the API endpoint in the SolanaPriceController class. It then makes a GET request to the API using the Net::HTTP library. If the request is successful, the response body is parsed as JSON and the price for the SOL token is extracted. If the request fails or there is an error parsing the JSON, an error message is displayed in the view.

The controller has two view files, one to display the price and another to display an error message if something goes wrong. The routes file is also updated to route the URL /solana_price to the show action in the SolanaPriceController class.

To add the code to Rails CRM, you would need to follow these steps:

Create a new controller: In the terminal, run rails generate controller SolanaPrice show. This will create a new controller file in the app/controllers folder and a view file in the app/views folder.

Replace the contents of the controller file with the code provided. Make sure to save the file.

Add the view files: Copy the code for the view files provided in the code snippet and paste it into the corresponding files in the app/views/solana_price folder.

Update the routes file: Open the config/routes.rb file and add the following line:

csharp
get '/solana_price', to: 'solana_price#show'
Restart your server: In the terminal, run rails server to restart your server.

Access the Solana price: You can now access the Solana price by visiting http://localhost:3000/solana_price in your browser.

Integrate the code: You can now integrate the Solana price display into your existing CRM by including the view files in your CRM views, or by calling the controller action from another controller and passing the data to the CRM views.
